## How to install
1. Make sure you have [Git Version Control](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer.

2. Make sure you have [Python3](https://www.python.org/) on your computer 

3. In your powershell or terminal, type `git clone https://github.com/andrewoconnell89/Tensorflow-Intro.git`

4. Move into that working directory by typing `cd Tensorflow-Intro`

5. Run the project by typing `python tensorflow_intro.py`


## Expected Output
The code will save pictures of the model's output over various epochs in the GradientDescentVisual folder.  In addition the computational graph will be saved in the model folder.  We can use Tensorboard for this.
