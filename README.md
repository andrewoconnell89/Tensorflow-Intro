## How to install
1. Make sure you have git installed on your computer.  If you don't go to https://git-scm.com/

2. In your powershell or terminal, type `git clone https://github.com/andrewoconnell89/Tensorflow-Intro.git`

3. Move into that working directory by typing `cd Tensorflow-Intro`

4. Run the project by typing `python tensorflow_intro.py`

5. The code will save pictures of the model's output over various epochs in the GradientDescentVisual folder

6. The Model will be saved in the model folder.  We can use Tensorboard for this.
